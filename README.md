## Usage:

The following is a very simple example of CRUD operations in an Aerospike database.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'aerospike'

include Aerospike

client = Client.new("127.0.0.1", 3000)

key = Key.new('test', 'set name', 'key value')
bins = {
  'bin1' => 'value1',
  'bin2' => 2,
  'bin4' => ['value4', {'map1' => 'map val'}],
  'bin5' => {'value5' => [124, "string value"]},
}

client.put(key, bins)
record = client.get(key)
record.bins['bin1'] = 'other value'

client.put(key, record.bins)
record = client.get(key)
puts record.bins

client.delete(key)
puts client.exists(key)

client.close
```
